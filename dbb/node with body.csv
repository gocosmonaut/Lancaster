The design provided a level of attention and refinement that was successful in creating a welcoming area for people to gather and obtain information about the Salem area. A kiosk area was established using existing wood columns, and the existing brick walls brought warmth and material expression to the space and also gave further reference to the existing structure.

The Travel Promotion Act will allow the United States to establish a multi-million dollar promotion program to compete on the global stage for the billions of dollars and immeasurable goodwill that would come with overseas travelers. The bill is expected to <!--break-->become law within 10 days.</p><p>‰ÛÏThe Salem area is an international destination with visitors from all corners of the globe,‰Ûù said Angie Morris, president and CEO of Travel Salem. ‰ÛÏInternational travelers seek out Salem for its authentic experiences, abundant and unique outdoor recreational opportunities, culinary bounty and rich historic amenities. This monumental legislation establishes a new revenue stream necessary to compete on the global stage. Travel Salem will continue its partnership with Travel Oregon as we look for new ways to attract international travelers and leverage this new legislation.‰Ûù</p><p>‰ÛÏThis is a historic victory for the U.S. economy and the one in eight American workers whose jobs depend on travel,‰Ûù said Roger Dow, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.åÊ ‰ÛÏThe United States Congress has sent a clear message that travel is a high priority to our nation and that tangible steps must be taken to increase travel to and within the United States. We are extremely grateful to the bill‰Ûªs champions: Senators Reid, Dorgan, Ensign and Klobuchar in the Senate and Representatives Delahunt, Blunt and Farr in the House.‰ÛùåÊ</p><p>The Travel Promotion Act establishes a public-private partnership to promote the United States as a premier international travel destination and communicate U.S. security and entry policies. According to analysis by Oxford Economics, the bill is estimated to drive $4 billion in new consumer spending annually, provide $321 million in new federal tax revenue each year and create 40,000 U.S. jobs nationwide. Further, it is expected to reduce the federal budget deficit by $425 million over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.åÊ</p><p>Overseas visitors spend an average of more than $4,000 when they visit the United States.</p><p>The Travel Promotion Act is modeled after successful state-level initiatives and is funded through a matching program featuring up to $100 million in private sector contributions and a $10 fee on foreign travelers who do not pay $131 for a visa to enter the United States. The fee is collected once every two years in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security‰Ûªs Electronic System for Travel Authorization. No money is provided by U.S. taxpayers.</p><p>The U.S. Travel Association is the national, non-profit organization representing all components of the $770 billion travel industry.

Superior customer service is a top priority for the tourism industry to ensure repeat visitation and promote a positive community brand. Just like photos and videos are used by visitors to remember and share their memories, the type of service a visitor receives impacts how they share their experience with friends and family. You‰Ûªve heard it before, customers that have a bad experience with a business tell at least <!--break-->10 friends ‰ÛÒ that‰Ûªs not the kind of ‰ÛÏword of mouth‰Ûù exposure that helps the bottom line. Going the extra mile for your customers will provide a huge return for the long-term health of your business. And many times it‰Ûªs the small things that make a big difference.</p><p>Some employees just have a knack with customers ‰ÛÒ they know how to please and deliver value because helping customers just comes naturally to them. These employees are incredibly valuable as they create loyal customers. Businesses can foster a strong customer service culture by encouraging all employees to become certified customer service professionals through Travel Oregon‰Ûªs free ‰ÛÏQ Care‰Ûù program. This online certification program develops strong customer service skills necessary for personal and professional growth.</p><p>The Quality Care (Q Care) Customer Service Training Program is a statewide certification created to support the growth of the tourism and hospitality industry through enhanced guest experiences. But you don‰Ûªt have to be a tourism-related business to participate or reap the benefits of a robust customer service program. The Q Care program provides Oregon employees with the tools and resources needed to better serve customers and visitors alike.</p><p>If growing your bottom line and increasing your market share are important to your business, invest in training your employees to be quality ambassadors for your organization. There is no expense to you other than staff time to complete the Q Care Training which only takes one hour.

Considered one of the catalysts in the revitalization of downtown Salem, the Salem Conference Center (SCC) has been a spark for driving economic impact and job creation to the area. Last year, SCC <!--break-->held 565 events that served more than 87,000 delegates ‰ÛÓ resulting in roughly 11,000 guest rooms booked at the Grand Hotel in Salem, and many other rooms booked at multiple properties throughout the city.</p><p>SCC increasingly satisfies the growing expectation of meeting planners and convention attendees for environmentally responsible venues. SCC is closing in on becoming LEED certified; an internationally recognized verification that a building is designed and built using sustainable practices.&nbsp; Next year, plans are in motion for solar panels to be installed on the roof to reduce energy consumption and costs. SCC already participates in a pilot program for composting, which allows food and waste from the catering kitchen to be recycled. These are just some examples of the Salem Conference Center‰Ûªs sustainable attributes that serve as a marketable asset to attract conventions and events to the Salem area.</p><p>Sustainability is also in Travel Salem‰Ûªs DNA. Travel Salem is certified EarthWISE ‰ÛÓ a Marion County program that recognize businesses who commit to environmentally friendly practices. Last year, Travel Salem assisted 87 conventions and distributed more than 7,000 biodegradable welcome bags. At the upcoming Association of Oregon Recyclers Conference to be held at the SCC in June, Travel Salem will embrace the ‰ÛÏgreen‰Ûù montra by arranging an information table staged with Salem area resources and staff who will provide the highest level of hospitality and encourage delegates to get out and experience the area‰Ûªs sustainable visitor amenities.

All of the respondents were pleasantly surprised to learn about tourism‰Ûªs significant impact.</p><p><strong>Just the Facts</strong><br />Tourism is a vital component of economic development, serving as one of America‰Ûªs largest industries and employers. In the Salem area, tourism is responsible for generating $18.6 million in tax receipts (2008 Travel Impacts research by Dean Runyan Associates), and the $500 million generated by visitors in the Salem area is responsible for 6,000 jobs. Simply put, when people travel, the economy grows, jobs are created, and the money goes right back into the local community.</p><p><strong>One Degree of Separation</strong><br />We all encounter someone directly involved with the tourism industry each day. It can be at the local coffee shop or specialty boutique; during lunch at your favorite restaurant; enjoying the agricultural offerings of a farmers‰Ûª market; while purchasing tickets to a theatrical performance; laughing over a glass or mug of award-winning wine or beer; or while fishing, birding or hiking. It can be as simple as fueling your car. All of these experiences and many more are tied to the tourism industry. Now think of all the indirect connections. What about the farmer that provides the ingredients for that amazing meal, or the paper product vendor that supplies your favorite coffee shop? And what about the realtor who is working with someone who, after visiting Salem, is now interested in relocating? Tourism touches all of us and connects with all corners of the economy.</p><p><strong>Mirror, Mirror on the Wall‰Û_</strong><br />Promoting the Salem area isn‰Ûªt about finding the ‰ÛÏfairest of them all;‰Ûù it is about promoting all of the various amenities of the region in an integrated way that connects with people and their interests. Selling the entire Salem area ‰ÛÓ not placing all of our marketing eggs into one basket ‰ÛÓ is important to attract a wide variety of people with diverse interests, who will stay longer to experience all the region has to offer. A visitor could experience a white water rafting trip on the Santiam River and then spend the evening at Historic Deepwood Estate‰Ûªs Wine Festival. That is the beauty of the Salem area ‰ÛÓ it really does have something for everyone!</p><p><strong>Understanding and Confirmation </strong><br />As our ‰ÛÏstreet teams‰Ûù discovered, the majority of people interviewed understand that tourism is a good, robust industry that adds to Salem‰Ûªs economic health. Some of our interviewees actually had visitors with them, which made it evident that visitors are among us each day adding to the vitality of our region. There was one couple that was from Sausalito, Calif. and, although they didn‰Ûªt participate in our research, they were thrilled to learn about the Travel CafÌ© Visitors Center and how it can assist them with planning their Salem adventure‰Û_another happy customer!</p><p>&nbsp;Yes, tourism works for America and Salem!</p><p>~ Angie Morris, president and CEO of Travel Salem<br /><em>*Originally printed in Statesman Journal, 5/16/10</em></p>",8,1,1274055306,1274199430,0,1,0,0,0,03040,5986,blog,,Save the Date!,"<p>Due to the volume of feedback and interest from attendees at Travel Salem‰Ûªs January <strong>Tourism Summit</strong> that was co-sponsored by Travel Oregon, we will be continuing the conversation in a true roundtable work session on <strong>September 21</strong>.

Companies must enter either the 100 Best Companies survey or the 100 Best Nonprofits survey to be eligible for the 100 Best Green ranking.

Instead of booking a flight to culinary capitals like Italy or Southern France, delve deeper into the culinary treasures in our own backyard: visit Prudence Uncorked (<a href=""http://www.prudenceuncorked.com"" target=""_blank"">www.prudenceuncorked.com</a>) to taste Oregon wild mushrooms on the menu. Save money on a Provence cheese tour, stop at Willamette Valley Cheese Company (<a href=""http://www.wvcheeseco.com"" target=""_blank"">www.wvcheeseco.com</a>) and munch on award-winning Herb de Provence Havarti. No need to fly to the East Coast for apple cider to swig down with a homemade donut stop by E.Z. Orchards Farm Market (<a href=""http://www.ezorchards.com"" target=""_blank"">www.ezorchards.com</a>) to get both. Or, if you like your cider hard, try Wandering Aengus' (<a href=""http://www.wanderingaengus.com"" target=""_blank"">www.wanderingaengus.com</a>) brews made in the American cider tradition.

I suggest waking up! Open your front door to a little fresh wintry air and find ways to bloom in the midst of winter, there are so many things to do in our region! Follow the lead of the Helleborus or Christmas Flower who blooms this month in shades like black, wine and berry. Go to <a href=""http://www.oregongarden.org"" target=""_blank"">The Oregon Garden</a> to visit her and other winter-blooming flowers like red Camelias or the tropical-smelling Daphne Odora.

More than 600 tandem cyclists pedaled through Spokane, Washington on the Fourth of July weekend at this year‰Ûªs Northwest rally and Travel Salem was there to promote Salem and encourage cyclists to attend the 2012 event.</p><p>The 2012 event will take place June 29th through July 2nd on cycling routes throughout the Salem region. The organizer of the rally is Salem NWTR 2010 LLC, a group of about 14 dedicated tandem cyclists living in the Salem area. Salem NWTR will partner with The Grand Hotel in Salem and Willamette University for food services and accommodations.</p><p>One of the organizers, Kurt Haas, who races with local Capitol Velo Racing Club, says the group is busy planning routes and<!--break--> locations for events.

Orchards, Willamette Valley Fruit Company, Bauman Farm and others.</p><p>Tandem teams are generally well-educated, affluent, and fit, with participants ranging from 25-60 and frequently include families with their children. The majority of NWTR participants come from Oregon, Washington and Northern California, with representation from across the country and some venturing from as far away as Europe and Australia.</p><p><img src=""http://www.travelsalem.com/files/images/Spokane_NWTR_2011_005.JPG"" width=""225"" height=""169"" style=""margin: 5px; float: right;"" />Organizers are excited about the energy the event will bring to the Salem area.</p><p>‰ÛÏMost people haven‰Ûªt seen 300 or 400 tandem bikes rolling down the road together; the rally really brings a buzz to the community,‰Ûù said Haas who rides tandem on a three-seated bike with his wife and seven-year old daughter. ‰ÛÏMany of the tandem riders are couples and families.

Wine Country plate proceeds will be directed to the Oregon Tourism Commission to support the promotion of Oregon as a travel &amp; tourism destination, and will be distributed as follows: 50% to matching grants for wine &amp; culinary tourism promotion 50% to regional tourism agencies throughout Oregon, based on an acreage formula of grapes in production</p><p>The bill was conceived and initiated by Travel Salem and co-sponsored by Senator Jackie Winters and Representative Kevin Cameron. The Oregon Winegrowers Association provided critical guidance and advocacy on behalf of the bill.</p><p><strong>WHY:</strong> This ‰ÛÏjobs bill‰Ûù was developed as an innovative marketing strategy to focus attention on Oregon‰Ûªs culinary scene, drive new tourism revenues to support economic growth across the state, and to galva-nize the tourism &amp; wine industries. The Wine Country plate celebrates Oregon‰Ûªs rich agricultural re-sources and world-class culinary heritage, and serves as a moving ‰ÛÏbillboard‰Ûù promoting Oregon‰Ûªs status as an agri-tourism hotspot. The plate provides Oregonians with the opportunity to show their support for the tourism industry and contribute toward a healthy and vibrant tourism economy.</p><p><strong>WHEN:</strong> At the earliest, plates will be available in January 2012.</p><p><strong>RESOURCES:<br /></strong>Angie Morris/President &amp; CEO, Travel Salem<br />503-581-4325 ext. 26, <a href=""mailto:amorris@TravelSalem.com"">amorris@TravelSalem.com</a></p><p>State Senator Jackie Winters<br />503-986-1710, <a href=""mailto:sen.jackiewinters@state.or.us"">sen.jackiewinters@state.or.us</a></p><p>State Representative Kevin Cameron<br />503-986-1400, <a href=""mailto:rep.kevincameron@state.or.us"">rep.kevincameron@state.or.us</a></p><p>Jim Bernau/President &amp; CEO, Willamette Valley Vineyards<br />503-588-9463, <a href=""mailto:jim.bernau@wvv.com"">jim.bernau@wvv.com</a></p><p>Michael Donovan/Managing Director, RoxyAnn Winery<br />541-776-2315 ext 304, <a href=""mailto:michael@roxyann.com"">michael@roxyann.com</a></p><p>Steve McCoid/President &amp; CEO, Oregon Restaurant &amp; Lodging Association<br />503-682-4422, <a href=""mailto:smccoid@OregonRLA.org"">smccoid@OregonRLA.org</a></p><p>Sue Horstmann/Executive Director, Willamette Valley Wineries Association<br />503-297-2962, <a href=""mailto:sue@willamettewines.com"">sue@willamettewines.com</a></p><p>Todd Davidson/CEO, Travel Oregon<br />503-378-8847, <a href=""mailto:todd@traveloregon.com"">todd@traveloregon.com</a></p><p>Kari Westlund/President &amp; CEO, Travel Lane County<br />541-743-8750, <a href=""mailto:Kari@TravelLaneCounty.org"">Kari@TravelLaneCounty.org</a></p><p>Sheryl Kelsh/Executive Director, Chehalem Chamber of Commerce<br />503-538-2014, <a href=""mailto:sheryl@chahalemvalley.org"">sheryl@chahalemvalley.org</a></p><p>Doug LaPlaca/President &amp; CEO, Visit Bend<br />541-382-8048, <a href=""mailto:doug@visitbend.com"">doug@visitbend.com</a></p><p>Lorna Davis/Executive Director, Newport Chamber of Commerce<br />541-265-8801, <a href=""mailto:lorna@newportchamber.org"">lorna@newportchamber.org</a></p><p>Alice Trindle/Executive Director, Eastern Oregon Visitors Association<br />541-856-3356, <a href=""mailto:tnthorse@eoni.com"">tnthorse@eoni.com</a></p><ul><li><a href=""/newsletters/volume-4-issue-9"">Back to newsletter</a></li></ul>",4,1,1313450745,1313536493,0,1,0,0,0,04931,9597,blog,,Delicious Summer Staycation Ideas!,"<p><img src=""http://www.travelsalem.com/files/images/POPPYVAL.JPG"" title=""Photo by Ron Cooper."" width=""196"" height=""130"" style=""margin: 5px; float: right;"" />Summer has arrived! The season of fun! It‰Ûªs a great time to plan ‰ÛÏstaycations‰Ûù close to home with family and friends: barefoot backyard BBQ‰Ûªs, trolling on Detroit lake, live music at Salem‰Ûªs Riverfront Park or days spent wine tasting through our region‰Ûªs vineyards. I‰Ûªd love to suggest a wonderful itinerary for those seeking adventure close to home. Don‰Ûªt underestimate how<!--break--> relaxing a night away from home can be; book a room at the <a href=""http://www.grandhotelsalem.com/"" target=""_blank"">Grand Hotel in Salem</a> where you can crawl into a perfect bed and not worry about making the bed when you wake. When the sun comes up, take a Salem Bicycle Taxi ride through Salem‰Ûªs Riverfront Park and over the Union Street Railroad Pedestrian &amp; Bicycle Bridge. Ride it to <a href=""http://www.historicdeepwoodestate.org/"" target=""_blank"">Historic Deepwood Estate</a> or the <a href=""http://www.salemart.org/"" target=""_blank"">Bush House Museum</a> to wander their gardens. For lunch, plan a picnic with supplies from a farm stand like <a href=""http://www.ezorchards.com/"" target=""_blank"">E.Z. Orchards Farm Market</a>: pints of blueberries, Italian olive oils, fine chocolates and a bottle of their champagne-like ‰ÛÏHard Cidre‰Ûù made from French apple varieties you might find in Northern France. Or order a dish of berry or peach shortcake with loads of whipped cream!</p><p>Pick up a pre-made picnic lunch created by Chef Karo Thom of <a href=""http://www.alcyonecafe.com/"" target=""_blank"">Alcyone CafÌ© &amp; Catering</a>, who makes to-die-for curried chicken and golden raisin salad or a wrap with prosciutto and mint, order some smoked salmon from <a href=""http://www.smokinseafood.com/"" target=""_blank"">Smokin‰Ûª Mike‰Ûªs Seafood Delights</a> and mini pies from <a href=""http://www.wvfco.com/"" target=""_blank"">Willamette Valley Fruit Company</a> and drive to <a href=""http://www.vanduzer.com/"" target=""_blank"">Van Duzer Vineyards</a> where you can spread out a colorful tablecloth, buy a bottle of Winemaker Jerry Murray‰Ûªs famous Pinot Gris and eat up! Bring along a kite, the Vineyard is situated in a special wind corridor, and when the breeze picks up, unfurl your kite into the sky to enjoy the same wind the raptors like to ride in the late afternoon. If you‰Ûªre in the mood to pair nature with wine, make a bee-line to <a href=""http://www.leftcoastcellars.com/"" target=""_blank"">Left Coast Cellars</a>, to see beehives dotting the vineyard (wild bees they‰Ûªve collected from their native oak trees) and walk their newly-developed 9-mile trail system while you enjoy Winemaker Luke McCollom‰Ûªs own Pinot Noir and eat carrot cake with buttery frosting from their onsite cafe. Want to learn about the intricacies of pairing wine and food?&nbsp; Invite a guest to your picnic: Byron Williams, owner of <a href=""http://www.grandcruwinetours.com/"" target=""_blank"">Grand Cru Wine Tours</a>, is an expert on what wines to pair with local cheeses and dishes. He‰Ûªll bring the food and the wine along‰ÛÓ you just pick the location!</p><p>Or head over to <a href=""http://www.wvv.com/"" target=""_blank"">Willamette Valley Vineyards</a> (WVV), order a dessert from their onsite restaurant and a bottle of delicious semi-sparkling Muscat-FrizzantÌ© (of the same requested for a special dinner hosted by former President Clinton) and sit on their veranda overlooking a Burgundy-esque valley of vineyards and farms below. If <a href=""http://gilgameshbrewing.com/"" target=""_blank"">Gilgamesh Brewing Company</a> is hosting one of their down-home brewing parties, leave WVV and follow the smell of sweet, yeasty hops to Gilgamesh‰Ûªs wooded brewery in Turner where they make experimental brews like their springy, mint kolsch. If you want the best of what‰Ûªs seasonal but don‰Ûªt want to do the foraging and cooking yourself, reserve a table at the <a href=""http://www.silvergrille.com/"" target=""_blank"">Silver Grille</a> in Silverton this month. Jeff Nizlek painstakingly prepares unforgettable dinners from scratch (he even makes his own salumi). Try his perfect summer salad of strawberries and candied hazelnuts or a chilled tomato soup that‰Ûªs as sweet as candy. If you‰Ûªre not ready to go home yet, drive into the wilderness and stay at the secluded <a href=""http://www.elkhornvalleyinnbedandbreakfast.com/"" target=""_blank"">Elkhorn Valley Inn Bed and Breakfast</a>&nbsp;where you‰Ûªll feel like you‰Ûªve left the world behind.</p><p>There is so much adventure right in our neck of the woods, it would be a shame if you drove right past!

Feast was held in Pioneer Courthouse Square and held events like the Sandwich Invitational, an Asian-inspired night market, high profile chef demonstrations, conversations with food thought leaders and a whole lot of eating and drinking.</p><p>While Portland was the center of this festival Salem was offered the opportunity to shine and represent the Willamette Valley at the<!--break--> Travel Oregon~Oregon Bounty Grand Tasting Tent ‰ÛÒ Saturday, September 22. Celebrated Salem chef Jeff James, represented the Wild Pear Restaurant, highlighting a 5-spiced cured Carlton Farms pork belly with E.Z. Orchards hard cider glaze, pears dipped in a Gouda cheese and maple syrup dip rolled in hazelnuts using the freshest local ingredients. Chef James along with, sisters and co-owners of the Wild Pear Restaurant, Cecelia and Jessica Ritter were on hand to talk to event goers and promote the agricultural bounty of the Willamette Valley and the Wild Pear. Kevin Zielinski with E.Z. Orchards Farm Market was serving tastes of their hard cidre and sharing information about their traditional French method of fermentation. Travel Salem representatives, Irene Bernards and Debbie McCune were greeting event attendees and promoting Salem‰Ûªs culinary scene as well as the amenities of the mid-Willamette Valley.</p><p>‰ÛÏOregon is a true cornucopia and the Willamette Valley is the corner stone of Oregon‰Ûªs bountiful harvests,‰Ûù said Irene Bernards, Marketing &amp; PR Director for Travel Salem. ‰ÛÏMarion County is Oregon‰Ûªs number one agricultural producing county and we had the opportunity to showcase the delicious offerings of the region and how local chefs partner with farmers and unify agricultural assets into culinary delights. We want visitors and Oregon residents to realize the foodie opportunities of our area,‰Ûù said Bernards.</p><p>Travel Salem approached the Wild Pear Restaurant about representing the Willamette Valley due to their commitment to local, seasonal and organic ingredients and how they use these ingredients in familiar and unexpected ways, whenever possible.</p><p>&nbsp;‰ÛÏWe are honored to have represented the Willamette Valley at the Oregon Bounty Grand Tasting Tent,‰Ûù said Cecilia and Jessica, Wild Pear Co-Owners. &nbsp;‰ÛÏWe are extremely fortunate to have Chef, Jeff James represent the Wild Pear and our mid-Willamette Valley region.

Chef James‰Ûª culinary culture and talents has paired well with our company where he has spent the last two years.

Yes, Israel. They were attending a wine bloggers conference being held in Portland and Travel Salem reached out to event organizers offering a ‰ÛÏSalem, Outside the Bottle‰Ûù pre-conference tour for interested delegates. Our goal? To showcase this region to these 20 individuals who would in turn promote it as a great place for wine and travel.</p> <p>We picked the group up in Portland and made many stops along the way showcasing wine but also the ‰ÛÏoutside the bottle‰Ûù amenities of the region.</p> <p>Our first stop was the<!--break--> <strong>Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum</strong> in McMinnville. The bloggers were treated to Evergreen‰Ûªs varietals as well as a tour of the aviation and space museum and water park.</p> <p>Then we headed south on 99W and enjoyed a relaxing stop at <strong>Johan Vineyards</strong> where a twisted horned cow welcomed us. The bloggers were busy snapping pictures and verbally and visually admiring the beauty of the pastoral geography. At Johan they experienced not only the fruit of the vine but they were introduced to ‰ÛÏwiking.‰Ûù Wiking is a combination of hiking while enjoying wine. We ‰ÛÏwiked‰Ûù through the vineyard toward our final destination for the day, Left Coast Cellars.</p> <p>The wine bloggers took part in a barrel tasting at <strong>Left Coast Cellars</strong> and a mouth-watering barbecue in the ‰ÛÏTree House‰Ûù ‰ÛÒa rustic covering adorned with twinkle lights. The barbecue also featured a variety of Left Coast Cellars wines, including a white Pinot, and the bloggers were able to share a knowledgeable wine exchange with the winemaker.</p> <p>As we headed toward Salem that night the motor coach was lit up by hand held devices. Already, these wine and travel influencers were blogging about their day. They were producing stories and posting photos promoting all they had experienced during day one of their tour. <strong>This is the reason we organized this event!</strong></p> <p>The next morning we kicked off the day at the <strong>Willamette Heritage Center at The Mill</strong> with an invigorating tour regarding Salem‰Ûªs wool industry and their exhibit ‰ÛÏHistory on Tap.‰Ûù Although this exhibit is no longer available it was really interesting. Be sure to check out their next exhibit ‰ÛÏThe Art &amp; Tradition of Kimono‰Ûù (Sept. 21-Dec. 24).</p> <p>Continuing on our tour we visited <strong>Willamette Valley Vineyards</strong> where all of the bloggers were treated to a cellar tour and tasting; a T-shirt that states ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs Willamette Dammit‰Ûù and a gourmet lunch including wine pairing tips and discussion.</p> <p>As we wound our way through the country roads to <strong>Piluso Vineyard &amp; Winery</strong> the conversation in the motor coach was lively. These folks were overwhelmed by the beauty of the region. They were discovering quality wines, sharing and learning about Oregon‰Ûªs wine making process and many were experiencing Oregon for the first time. A large majority asked questions about moving to the area and how they would love to live here.</p> <p>The bloggers discovered a ‰ÛÏboutique‰Ûù winery at Piluso Vineyard &amp; Winery and they took the opportunity to delve into the detail of the vines, the soil and how those translate into the grape and the flavors it extracts.</p> <p>We ended our tour at <strong>E.Z. Orchards Farm Market</strong> sampling peach and strawberry shortcake and their hard cidre, which is produced similarly to wine. These wine connoisseurs were delighted with the cidre and really enjoyed learning more about the process.</p> <p>As the tour was winding down I realized that although I live here, and I‰Ûªm well versed in the bounty and wealth of opportunities for visitors, this was the first time I experienced the Salem area through the fresh eyes of twenty ‰ÛÏwine hungry‰Ûù visitors. Visitors whose purpose is to share their wine experiences; to share their travel experiences and to encourage their readers to visit new places and savor all the beauty that is wine‰Û_and everything that is also ‰ÛÏoutside the bottle.‰Ûù</p> <p>As I write this article, I can barely keep up with the blogs posted from the tour and the positive comments regarding our area and the tour. I would be remiss for not mentioning that everything included in this tour was donated by those mentioned above as well as four local lodging establishments that contributed the overnight rooms for the bloggers (<strong>Grand Hotel in Salem</strong>, <strong>Hampton Inn &amp; Suites</strong>, <strong>Red Lion Hotel</strong> and the <strong>Comfort Suites Salem Airport</strong>). Thank you for helping make this promotion of the Salem area possible!</p> <p>Here are a few of the bloggers comments to share:</p> <p>‰ÛÏLove Oregon and Oregonians!!!‰Ûù ~ <em>WineCountryGetaways</em></p> <p>‰ÛÏThe wineries, people and wines were just the best. I am so impressed with the people we met and the wine they craft.

The variety of activities was such a great blend of cultural attractions, wineries and the great Oregon outdoors. Everyone was so gracious ‰ÛÒ I‰Ûªm still blown away by the hospitality.

I only wish we had more time at each place! Which means I must return for a longer visit. This was a great introduction to the Willamette Valley for me, and I now have a better awareness of what Oregon is doing in the wine world. I also appreciated the variety of wineries.

Yes, it‰Ûªs rainy, but with the right gear and attitude, we can enjoy the beauty of the great outdoors during the winter months. So, grab your rain gear, seize your sense of adventure, and plan a ‰ÛÏwintercation‰Ûù in the mid-Willamette Valley.</p> <p>For an authentic Northwest adventure this winter, head to<!--break--> the <a href=""http://www.detroitlakeoregon.org"" target=""_blank""><strong>Detroit Lake Recreation Area</strong></a>. Located in the heart of the Willamette National Forest, much of the 3,500 acre area is accessible year round. If you like to hike or snow shoe, you‰Ûªll enjoy many miles of trails that lead through misty old growth forests and snow-covered clearings. Detroit Lake is also open to boaters in winter months. A winter boat ramp was constructed in 2009 at Mongold State Park, making it possible to launch a boat safely during the winter months when other ramps in the lake are on dry ground. Also located just a few miles east of Detroit is the <strong>McCoy Creek snowmobile area</strong>, featuring 60 miles of well-maintained trails and even a designated snowmobile shelter.</p> <p>If you‰Ûªre heading to Detroit, plan to stay overnight at <strong><a href=""http://www.lodgeatdetroitlake.com"" target=""_blank"">The Lodge at Detroit Lake</a></strong>. Renovated in 2010, these cozy cabins offer the best of both worlds: a rustic lodge feel and modern amenities including flat screen TV‰Ûªs, gas fireplaces, and in-room Wi-Fi. Soothe your muscles after a day of hiking or snowshoeing with a hot bath in a jetted tub, which comes standard in every room. And if you forget to bring your toothbrush, don‰Ûªt worry. <strong>Mountain High Grocery &amp; Gifts</strong>&nbsp;is conveniently located close to The Lodge and stocks the essentials, plus snacks and small souvenir items. On your way to or from Detroit, be sure to stop at <a href=""http://www.rosiesscones.com"" target=""_blank""><strong>Rosie‰Ûªs Mountain Coffeehouse</strong></a> in Mill City for their famous scones, a cup of hot java, or a bowl of delicious homemade soup.</p> <p>Whether you‰Ûªre an experienced fisherman or just getting your feet wet, winter can be a great time to plan a fishing trip. <strong><a href=""http://www.oregonoutdoorexcursions.com"" target=""_blank"">Oregon Outdoor Excursions</a></strong> offers guided trips throughout the year, including a ‰ÛÏSiletz River Winter Steelhead‰Ûù trip. Take advantage of their guides‰Ûª knowledge and expertise as you drift down the Siletz, fishing for steelhead.</p> <p>Winter is also an ideal time for viewing certain types of wildlife. Just west of Salem lies the <strong><a href=""http://www.fws.gov/willamettevalley/baskett"" target=""_blank"">Baskett Slough National Wildlife Refuge</a></strong> ‰ÛÒ a sanctuary for wintering geese, great blue heron, hawks and other birds and mammals. Winter is the best time to see the dusky Canada goose or catch a glimpse of the beautiful Bald Eagle.</p> <p>For a unique experience you won‰Ûªt soon forget, consider a horseback adventure with <strong>Into the Wild Equine Adventures</strong>, a family-owned and operated trail riding business specializing in intimate, guided group trail rides. While summer is the busiest season for tours, the company also offer a limited number of winter rides exploring the foothills of the Cascade Range.</p> <p>For a cold weather outing close to the city, head to <strong><a href=""http://www.cityofsalem.net/Residents/Parks/ParkTour/Pages/Minto-Brown%20Island%20Park.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Minto-Brown Island Park</a></strong>. This nearly 900-acre natural park offers many miles of trails for walking, jogging, biking, and hiking, and also boasts one of the largest off-leash dog parks in the Northwest.

Why, then, was Oregon allowing out-of-state, online corporations to dodge their full tax obligations?</p><p>House Bill 2656 was introduced to the Oregon Legislature and recently passed. The bill levels the playing field for local transient lodging taxes. These taxes are paid by Online Travel Companies (OTC‰Ûªs) such as Expedia and Orbitz, and local hoteliers.&nbsp;</p><p>The Oregon Destination Marketing Organization (ODMO) worked cooperatively to <!--break-->assist with the passage of HB 2656. ODMO is a non-profit organization representing destination marketing organizations (such as Travel Salem), convention and visitors bureaus, and chambers of commerce responsible for marketing specific geographic areas as visitor destinations.</p><p>Transient lodging tax dollars expended on tourism promotion and activities in our local communities have decreased during the recent economic downturn. This negatively impacts jobs and revenues for the state. One reason for the decrease is that out-of-state companies don‰Ûªt pay the same amount of transient lodging taxes as our local businesses.</p><p>Currently, some rooms booked online through OTC‰Ûªs do not generate the same amount of taxes as those booked directly through the hotel. In some cases, a hotel enters a contract with an OTC to provide rooms at a discounted rate, i.e. the ‰ÛÏwholesale cost.‰Ûù The OTC then posts the rooms at a higher rate to consumers. This is referred to as the ‰ÛÏwholesale booking model.‰Ûù</p><p>OTC‰Ûªs typically calculate state and local hotel occupancy taxes based on the ‰ÛÏwholesale cost‰Ûù they pay to a hotel, rather than the ‰ÛÏretail price‰Ûù they charge the customer. This practice results in lower taxes collected by state and local jurisdictions for rooms booked through an OTC, rather than directly with a hotel.</p><p>If a guest books a room directly through a hotel, the tax reflects the jurisdictions rate where the hotel is located. For example, Mr. Public books a room in Anytown, USA, through a hotel‰Ûªs website. The room rate is $100 and Anytown levies a 10% occupancy tax on rooms, so a total of $110 is charged to Mr. Public. The hotel then remits the $10 occupancy tax to the city.</p><p>In contrast, if Mr. Public books the same room through an OTC, the charge will still be $110 to cover the room rate, plus the OTC‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏtaxes and fees.‰Ûù &nbsp;The OTC then calculates the occupancy tax based on what it owes the hotel, rather than what it charged the consumer. Implementing the ‰ÛÏwholesale booking model,‰Ûù the OTC remits only $88 to the hotel ($80 for the contracted cost of the room and $8 for the occupancy taxes), and the OTC retains the remaining $22 from the transaction.</p><p>Many jurisdictions have become aware of this strategy and have filed lawsuits against some of the OTC‰Ûªs for these unpaid tax revenues. In response, the OTC‰Ûªs are seeking legislation that would protect this practice by making it a legitimate tax exemption through a federal preemption of state and local authority.</p><p>ODMO has worked with local governments, tourism promotion groups and industry members to develop a statewide standard and to ensure state and local tourism dollars are uniformly collected. House Bill 2656 will establish a statewide standard for the rate for taxes on rooms in Oregon stating, ‰ÛÏAll rooms in Oregon will be taxed at the room rate paid by the consumer.‰Ûù This proposal will only apply to future sales of rooms occupied after the time of the enacted date.</p><p>HB 2656 will ensure that out-of-state companies, including OTC‰Ûªs, pay the same amount of taxes as local businesses. This will help level the playing field and maximize the resources our communities have for tourism promotion.</p><p>Travel Salem would like to thank ODMO for their work on HB 2656 and for their advocacy for Oregon‰Ûªs tourism industry.</p><ul><li><a href=""/newsletters/july-15-2013"">Back to newsletter</a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul></ul>",19,1,1373498032,1373667543,0,1,0,0,0,08069,14583,blog,,Renewed Travel Caf’© Hours,"<p><img src=""http://www.travelsalem.com/files/images/Pavillion-with-Barb-Ron%20Cooper.JPG"" width=""200"" height=""133"" style=""margin: 5px; float: right;"" />As of July 1, Travel Salem‰Ûªs Travel CafÌ© Visitors Center operating hours have been renewed for FY 2013-14 to: Monday through Friday 9:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m., Saturday 10:00 a.m.-4:00 p.m. and closed on Sunday.&nbsp;</p><p>Our professional guest services representatives serve as the region‰Ûªs concierge providing Salem visitors and residents with expert local resources and recommendations to enhance their experience. &nbsp;The Travel CafÌ© Visitors Center offers <!--break-->ticket sales to events and attractions, GPS rentals, and customized itineraries.</p><p>Travel Salem oversees a visitor information network that includes an official Oregon Travel Plaza located at the BEST WESTERN PLUS Mill Creek Inn, which is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; as well as locations at the Red Lion Hotel, Salem Conference Center, Salem Airport, Amtrak, Lancaster Mall, Aurora Airport, the Willamette Heritage Center at The Mill, AAA‰Ûªs office, and the Phoenix Inn Suites South.</p><ul><li><a href=""/newsletters/july-15-2013"">Back to newsletter</a></li></ul><ul></ul>",19,1,1373500243,1373667921,0,1,0,0,0,08070,14586,blog,,12-13 Third Quarter Report,"<p>Travel Salem‰Ûªs 12-13 Third Quarter Report is available for review at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.travelsalem.com/about-us/reports-research"" target=""_blank"">TravelSalem.com</a>.</p><p>Questions?

The Oregon State Capitol FoundationÕs Special Events Committee, and Capitol staff, has been hard at work planning a celebration. Visitors will enjoy tours, music and special displays reflecting the history of the Capitol. Plans also include a ÒLight up the DomeÓ event <!--break-->with super-sized birthday candles surrounding the Capitol dome.</p><p>Rich in history, Oregon's present Capitol has its origins in two fires. On December 30, 1855, fire swept through a newly occupied Statehouse, completely destroying the structure. On April 25, 1935, fire again destroyed the elegant Statehouse patterned after the U.S. Capitol.</p><p>The current building was dedicated October 1, 1938. A four-story structure of Modern Greek architecture, it was completed at a cost of $2.5 million. The building houses several elected state officials - the Governor, the Secretary of State, and the State Treasurer - in addition to the entire Legislative Branch of state government.&nbsp;</p><p>A Capitol ""Wings"" project completed in 1977, at a cost of $12.5 million, added further space for legislative offices, hearing rooms, support services, a first floor galleria, and underground parking.</p><p>In the late 1990's a series of health and safety issues were identified in the Capitol wings. The 74th Legislature approved the ""Capitol Restoration Project"" in June 2007. Work in the Capitol wings took place between July 2007 and November 2008.</p><p>ItÕs not too late to join the celebration! Do you have an idea or event you would like to host?

The Marion County Economic Development Advisory Board (EDAB) will review and rank all applications, then make recommendations to the Marion County Board of Commissioners for funding approval.

Our priority is to assist employers already based here to strengthen their businesses.

This makes it a great resource when planning staycations with family and friends.</p><p>The IOM offers points of interest (POI) that will attract new visitors and lengthen the stay of current visitors to the region (Salem, Polk County, Marion County). &nbsp;Since the map is interactive, visitors can see the general location of the POI. They can then zoom in as far as street level and scroll over an icon which opens a pop-up with the name of the business and a brief description. A corresponding list with photos is also located in the left sidebar and provides a direct link to businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>The Travel Salem IOM illustrates how much there is to see and do in our region, while also promoting visitation. Phase I of this project was funded by a Travel Oregon grant and Phase II is made possible through a Polk County grant.</p><p>Want to know if your business qualifies for a listing on Travel SalemÕs Interactive Online Map?

But lately, a picture has emerged of travel as a health regimen‰ÛÓfor our bodies and minds, our family relationships and our country‰Ûªs economy.</p><p>Take, for instance, jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the U.S. travel industry recovered faster than other economic sectors. Since losing close to half a million jobs in the Great Recession, the travel industry has added 697,000 jobs and <!--break-->has outpaced job creation by the rest of the economy by 49 percent.</p><p>But unless you work for the airlines or own a hotel, does the travel rebound mean much to the average American? The answer is a resounding yes.</p><p>Travel is among the top 10 employers in 49 states, directly employing about eight million people at a payroll of $209 billion. Throw in jobs supported by travel and the number almost doubles to 15 million workers: one of every nine American jobs.<em></em></p><p>In Oregon, travel and tourism generates $9.6 billion and directly supports nearly 94,000 jobs. In the Salem area, the industry generates $537.2 in economic impact and supports 6,110 jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></p><p>But travel doesn‰Ûªt just grow our economy and boost our productivity; it also connects us as people, keeps us healthy and makes us happy. People who travel are less stressed and happier at work. Eight in 10 seniors say travel makes them feel energized. And our travel memories stay with us: studies show that into our 50s and beyond, we remember childhood trips more vividly than birthday parties or other special occasions.</p><p>So, as we celebrate National Travel &amp; Tourism Month this May, please take a few minutes to think about how you can support and encourage travel ‰ÛÓ perhaps as an employer, as a leader in your community or even just for you and your family. It‰Ûªs worth our investment, and the travel effect pays us back in spades.</p><p><a href=""/newsletters/may-19-2014"" style=""background-color: transparent; text-align: right;"">Back to newsletter</a></p>",19,1,1399930396,1400259989,0,1,0,0,0,09781,17808,blog,,Do You Belong in the Travel Caf’©?,"<p><img src=""http://www.travelsalem.com/files/images/IMG_0071_400.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""278"" /></p><p>With summer just around the corner, we have already seen an increase in visitors searching for information about attractions, special events and interesting venues in the area.

Travel Salem is pleased to announce that it has secured the 2016 US Quidditch (USQ) Northwest Regional Championship Tournament, which will take place February 6 and 7 at the Capital Futbol Club Soccer Complex in Salem.<!--break-->&nbsp;</p><p>The 2016 tournament will be the second regional championship for the Northwest region. (The 2015 event was held in Tukwila, Washington). Fourteen teams - approximately 280 players - from Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and British Columbia are expected to compete in the 2016 tournament.&nbsp;</p><p>Brian Chung, Travel Salem‰Ûªs sports and events sales manager, estimates that the cash infusion into the local economy from the tournament will be approximately $58,240.</p><p>&nbsp;‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre really excited to host the USQ Northwest Regional tournament in Salem,‰Ûù said Chung. ‰ÛÏNot only does it mean a spike in business for hotels, shops and restaurants during a time of year when business is typically slower, but hosting an event that is still relatively new to the Northwest is sure to generate positive publicity for Salem and draw plenty of spectators who want to see how the sport is played.‰Ûù</p><p>Inspired by the game featured in the Harry Potter book series, quidditch is a gender integrated, contact sport that mixes elements of rugby, dodgeball and tag. Each team has a chaser that can score goals, a keeper who defends the goal, two beaters who try to ‰ÛÏknock out‰Ûù other players and a seeker who tries to catch the snitch ‰ÛÒ which consists of a ball attached to a neutral player. Players must carry a broom between their legs at all times.&nbsp;</p><p>To be selected to host a regional USQ tournament, a city must be able to provide certain essentials, such as electricity, adequate field space for matches and visitor information services throughout the tournament. ‰ÛÏWe were impressed with Salem‰Ûªs facilities, the level of support from the city and the enthusiasm for the sport of quidditch,‰Ûù said Sarah Woolsey, USQ events director.&nbsp;</p><p>The top qualifiers in the Northwest Regional Championship Tournament will move on to compete in the US Quidditch Cup 9, April 16-17 in Columbia, South Carolina.&nbsp;</p><p>Although there is no Salem area team currently registered with US Quidditch, it‰Ûªs feasible that a team could join the organization and meet the basic requirements in time to compete in the Northwest Regional Tournament in February.&nbsp;</p><p>‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªd love to see a Salem area team form and then play in the regional tournament,‰Ûù said Woolsey. Membership in US Quidditch is open to teams and individuals in any age group in the United States.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>History of US Quidditch</strong></p><p>Quidditch got its start in the United States in 2005 at Middlebury College when then-freshman Xander Manshel and his classmates were looking for a variation on their normal Sunday activities. Manshel and his friends laid the foundation for a game that has grown to become a widely respected, physically intense sport. Today, there are more than 4,000 athletes on almost 200 teams nationwide.&nbsp;</p><p>For more information about quidditch or forming a team, go to <a href=""http://www.usquidditch.org"" target=""_blank"">www.usquidditch.org</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""/newsletters/october-2015"" style=""background-color: transparent; text-align: right;"">Back to newsletter</a></p>",19,1,1444847804,1444860778,0,1,0,0,0,012068,21599,blog,,Travel Salem Makes List of 100 Best Nonprofits to Work For in Oregon,"<p><img src=""http://www.travelsalem.com/files/images/TravelCafePano-450.jpg"" title=""Travel Salem selected as one of top 100 best nonprofits to work for ~ Photo by Ron Cooper"" width=""450"" height=""194"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" /></p><p><a href=""http://www.travelsalem.com/about-us/overview"" target=""_blank"">Travel Salem</a> is pleased to announce it has been selected as one of the ‰ÛÏ100 Best Nonprofits to Work For in Oregon‰Ûù by <em><a href=""http://www.oregonbusiness.com/"" target=""_blank"">Oregon Business</a></em> magazine. <!--break--><a href=""http://www.oregonbusiness.com/"" target=""_blank"">The 100 Best Nonprofits list</a> is comprised of the top 34 large, 33 medium and 33 small nonprofits that participated in the survey.

Should I join Travel Salem anyway? ,"<p>While you may not offer a service directly to the visitor, your business might be important to front line hospitality businesses like hotels, restaurants, car rental agencies, etc. Many ""non-visitor industry"" businesses join Travel Salem to form relationships with front-line visitor service businesses. Some examples are web designers, banks, accountants, promotional products companies, and video production companies.</p>",1,1,1232712060,1232712060,2,1,0,0,0,099,99,faq,,How is the Travel Salem different from a Chamber of Commerce? ,<p>Convention and Visitors Associations (CVA) are similar to Chambers of Commerce in that both organizations develop the economic health and vitality of the community. CVA's use tourism and convention marketing as an economic development strategy. A Chamber of Commerce will usually have a broader focus for developing the business community.</p>,1,1,1232712124,1232712124,2,1,0,0,0,0100,100,faq,,Why have Membership fees increased?,"<p>The industry has become more sophisticated in how destination marketing organizations (DMOs) market their products and services, and deliver value to the communities they serve. Travel Salem has evolved over the last couple years as well reinventing itself to be more in line with industry standards and progressive in its approach.</p> <p>After researching membership structures regionally and nationally, Travel Salem developed a brand-new concept for membership that allows businesses to pick and choose which marketing options best meet their needs, and ultimately control their financial investment. The new program offers marketing options not previously available and the dues reflect this change. The dues are cost effective for the return on the investment ‰ÛÒ averaging $450 for an entire year of promotion. Membership with Travel Salem delivers tangible benefits through value-driven programs and services.</p> <p>Travel Salem remains committed to a basic level of marketing support for the City of Salem. The following services will continue to be provided at no charge to businesses within Salem city limits ‰ÛÒ leads for conferences and events, weekly consumer and industry e-newsletter, regional and national public relations efforts, and leisure and conference advertising.</p>",1,0,1232712146,1443033092,2,0,0,0,0,0101,101,faq,,Why is Travel Salem charging for marketing services that used to be free?,"<p>Marketing options such as the Visitors Guide listings used to be free, right? Not exactly, listing fees were included in the display advertising rates. These fees are now sold separately so Members can mix and match options to build their own marketing package. The goal is to give Members more flexibility in choosing marketing services. For instance, some businesses want a listing but not a display ad, and vice versa.</p> <p>What about putting a brochure in the Visitors Center ‰ÛÒ that used to be free? Yes ‰ÛÒ it was a free service previously. Because of limited space for displaying brochures, Travel Salem is now charging a nominal annual fee for businesses who want their materials distributed. These fees go back into supporting the operation of the Visitors Center.</p> <p>Another reason for the change is that for every $1 received from the City of Salem, Travel Salem has to generate an additional $3 from outside sources. We are flanked to the north and south by organizations with multi-million marketing budgets. And in order to operate as a regional DMO serving Salem, Marion and Polk counties, Travel Salem needs broad-based financial support to succeed in this extremely competitive tourism industry.</p>",1,0,1232712178,1443033138,2,0,0,0,0,0102,102,faq,,Why is there an _—“inside_—ù and _—“outside_—ù pricing structure?,"<p>Travel Salem must operate under the City of Salem‰Ûªs Charter which states that transient occupancy tax dollars (TOT or lodging tax dollars) collected by the City of Salem can only be used to promote the city of Salem. However, the City of Salem also understands that the assets of the entire region benefit Salem, and conversely that Salem‰Ûªs assets benefit the region. In order for Travel Salem to serve as a regional DMO, the Association must generate additional revenues to leverage current marketing dollars provided by the City of Salem.</p><p>The ‰ÛÏinside‰Ûù pricing is for businesses located within Salem city limits. Businesses located ‰ÛÏoutside‰Ûù the Salem city limits pay an additional percentage. For Travel Salem to operate within its contractual obligations with the City of Salem and within the parameters of the law/City Charter, the ‰ÛÏoutside‰Ûù fees are a necessity.</p>",1,1,1232712220,1232712220,2,1,0,0,0,0103,103,faq,,I don't have time to go to networking events.

With Travel Salem‰Ûªs very own Sal at their side, guests can tour the hotel, call the front desk, check meeting times, current events from Travel Salem, and then be navigated to local shops and restaurants.

Or, where is that new restaurant they saw on the TV and what do they have on their menu? And, what time is that meeting? When can we have breakfast? Now guests can scan the entire hotel directory info on their phones. Visitors can also download the app on the Google Play or Apple app store and enter hotel code 1244, or simply scan in a QR code that Sal provides at the front desk. The app even offers a free slot game.</p><p>Hotel staff point out ""In these economic times, mid-level hotels cannot afford to hire a full-time concierge so ""Concierge To Go"" solves this problem and offers a 24/7 digital concierge personalized to the hotel, as well as a personal welcome from Salem‰Ûªs mascot.""</p><p>Oregon based HospitalityVision works with Travel Salem to provide a visitor‰Ûªs information channel in six local hotels and at the Travel CafÌ©.

Visiting one, or a handful, makes for a pleasant and easy daytrip.</p><p>Head west along Highway 22 to loop through the Van Duzer corridor. Here vines get the benefit of temperate afternoon breezes and cool evenings ‰ÛÒ perfect growing conditions for exceptional Pinot noir. Wineries in this area include Johan Vineyards, Firesteed and NamastÌ© Vineyards. At Van Duzer Vineyards, visitors are treated to award-winning wines and breathtaking views of the valley from the trellised terrace off the tasting room ‰ÛÒ the perfect spot for a picnic lunch.</p><p>If you‰Ûªd rather break up a day with a more traditional lunch stop, head to Left Coast Cellars; the cozy cafÌ©, decorated with a Scandinavian twist, features soups, panini sandwiches, pizza and small plates that complement the house wines. From there, head south to Eola Hills Wine Cellars. Open year-round and producing more than two dozen wines, Eola Hills‰Ûª serene setting and koi ponds offer a relaxing spot to pass an afternoon.</p><p>Another option for a wine loop west of Salem is up and along the ridge of the Eola Hills. This will take you by Cubanisimo Vineyards, St. Innocent Winery, Witness Tree Vineyard, Redhawk Vineyard &amp; Winery, and Stangeland Vineyards and Winery ‰ÛÒ each one producing standout wines.</p><h2>CIDER &amp; BREWS</h2><p>Traditional hard cider is experiencing a revival in the Willamette Valley. Two early adopters are Wandering Aengus Ciderworks and E.Z. Orchards. For a taste of both, head to Wandering Aengus‰Ûª tasting room and sidle up to the sustainable hardwood bar to sample from a rotation of ciders, ranging from semi-dry to floral. Lite fare, local beers, wines and cheeses are also available.</p><p>Beer-lovers should seek out Gilgamesh Brewing, whose innovative brews have spawned a devoted following. Gilgamesh can be found at their own tasting room (open on select dates), on local menus, or at frequent pop-up events.</p><p>Salem‰Ûªs Ram Restaurant &amp; Brewery is home to Big Horn Brewing Company and its ales, lagers and handcrafted brews. Just across the Willamette in Independence (once the hop capital of the world) is an outpost of one of Oregon‰Ûªs most lauded brewers, the venerable Rogue Ales. Raise a glass of artisan brew at the Chatoe Rogue Tasting Room, take a tour of the adjacent hop fields and processing facility, or relax with a friendly round of croquet.</p>",19,1,1231826367,1406669961,0,0,0,0,0,022,18103,page,,Recreation,"<h2>Wild Oregon</h2><p>Oregon features some of the most scenic wild areas in the United States, and the Willamette Valley is no exception.

Salem joins cities such as Paris, Buenos Aires, London, New York, Berlin, Shanghai and 93 other cities throughout the world as an official Greeter destination, where thousands of volunteers worldwide share their personal insights and knowledge about ‰ÛÏtheir city‰Ûù with visitors.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is Greeters?<br /></strong>The Greeter program is still unknown to many people, but the concept is rapidly catching on throughout the world. In the last three months, more than 10 cities have joined the network including Sofia, Bulgaria; Sydney, Australia; and Vienna, Austria.</p><p>The concept is simple and based on the idea that most people are truly proud and passionate about their city. &nbsp;A Greeter volunteer shares knowledge about a destination - not as a tour guide but as a resident of the city, sharing his or her personal story and knowledge about the history and culture of the city. Greeters follow a strict no tipping policy. The walk - or greet, as Greeter destinations call it - &nbsp;is a gift from the host city to the visitor.</p><p><strong>History<br /></strong>The Greeters program officially started in 1992, but was founded on principles introduced by the late Lynn Brooks, who was born and raised in New York in the 1920s. Lynn was troubled by the poor image of the city and decided to show people the ‰ÛÏgood side of her village.‰Ûù Based on Lynn‰Ûªs initial work, the Big Apple Greeters Program was born. Over the last five years, the Greeters concept has gained momentum as more people want to start a local Greeter organization in their community to build upon the services offered to visitors.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Facts and Figures<br /></strong></p><ul><li>At the end of 2013, there were approximately 50 to 60 destinations participating in the Global Greeter Network. &nbsp;At the end of 2015, well over 150 destinations will be involved. &nbsp;At the end of 2016, it‰Ûªs anticipated that between 350 and 400 destinations will have joined GGN ‰ÛÒ representing a growth rate of 700% over three years.</li><li>As a mostly virtual organization, GGN receives no formal funding. All advertising is based on free publicity, social media and ‰ÛÏword of mouth‰Ûù marketing.&nbsp;</li><li>Greeter services are completely free. Sometimes visitors do not know how to accept this type of service for free as they expect one needs to tip the Greeter but it is a completely free service. Greeters are willing to share their time and information with visitors because they love their city.&nbsp;</li><li>The Greeter program works in partnership with local tourism organizations, based on the logical concept that the best ambassadors for a city are its inhabitants. This is the strength of the Greeter concept and likely the main reason there is a growing number of destination marketing organizations such as Travel Salem that are interested in setting up a local Greeter organization. Each destination marketing organization creates the digital infrastructure (i.e. website, matching the volunteer Greeter with the visitor, providing information) while maintaining the global concept.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong style=""line-height: 20.3999996185303px; background-color: transparent;"">Greeters in the USA<br /></strong>Now there are USA-Greeter destinations in New York, Chicago, Houston and <strong style=""line-height: 20.3999996185303px;"">Salem, Oregon</strong>. Additional Greeters destinations are expected to be formed in the USA soon.</p><p><strong>More information<br /></strong>For more information about the Global Greeter Network, go to <a href=""http://www.GlobalGreeterNetwork.info"" target=""_blank"">www.GlobalGreeterNetwork.info</a> or email <a href=""mailto:100members@globalgreeternetwork.info"" target=""_blank"">100members@globalgreeternetwork.info</a>.

Make plans to visit Oregon‰Ûªs capital to see what‰Ûªs new and noteworthy in 2015.</p> <p>One of the most exciting changes in downtown Salem is the recent re-opening of the historic McGilchrist and Roth Building. Originally built in 1916, this beautifully renovated building is home to three new shops worth checking out: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/gayle.doty.50""><strong>Gayle‰Ûªs Italian Market</strong></a>, an authentic Italian shop featuring artisan cheeses, meats, wood-fired pizza and more; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rickys-Bubbles-Sweets-Shoppe/594956577222824""><strong>Ricky‰Ûªs Bubbles &amp; Sweets</strong></a><strong>, </strong>a bright store featuring old-fashioned candies and whimsical gifts; and <a href=""http://www.archivecoffeeandbar.com""><strong>Archive</strong></a><strong>, </strong>a hip, urban coffee shop by day and Prohibition Era-inspired bar at night. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Salem‰Ûªs culinary scene continues to grow with the addition of several new eateries this year. In downtown, <a href=""http://tablefive08.com/""><strong>tableFIVE 08</strong></a> unites the culinary talents of executive chef Jason Freeburg and chef de cuisine Alexander Baccarat - both graduates of New York‰Ûªs prestigious Culinary Institute of America. The restaurant prides itself on creating food that satisfies the palates of those who enjoy fresh, local food with dynamic flavor. A few miles outside of Salem in the small town of Sublimity is <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Panezanellie-Breadstick-Shoppe/116764621710736?fref=ts""><strong>Panezanellie‰Ûªs Breadstick Shoppe</strong></a>. Back under the guidance of its original owner, this unassuming cafÌ© serves up some of the most delectable breadsticks, sticky buns and flatbread pizza in the Willamette Valley.</p> <p>In June, the<strong> </strong><a href=""http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2014/06/post_183.html""><strong>Oregon WWII Memorial</strong></a><strong> </strong>was unveiled in Salem.<strong> </strong>Located on the grounds of the<strong> </strong><a href=""https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/""><strong>Oregon State Capitol</strong></a><strong>, </strong>this $1.22 million recognizes the service and sacrifice of the 152,000 Oregonians who served during WW II. The names of the 3,771 Oregonians killed in action are also inscribed on a black granite wall that serves as part of the memorial. &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>A few Salem area wineries also expanded their operations this past year. One of the newest venues was created by <a href=""http://www.brookswine.com/""><strong>Brooks Winery</strong></a>. The 12,000-square-foot tasting room features stunning views of the vineyards and plenty of space to sip and relax with friends and family. <a href=""http://www.eolahillswinery.com/""><strong>Eola Hills Winery</strong></a> also expanded, this year. Their new <a href=""http://www.eolahillswinery.com""><strong>Legacy Estate Vineyard</strong></a> features a rustic tasting room with a lovely view of the man-made pond, plus 300 acres that are open to visitors for hiking and exploring. In late spring, <a href=""http://namastevineyards.com/""><strong>Namaste Vineyards</strong></a> opened a second tasting room, conveniently located on Highway 99 between Rickreall and Monmouth.<strong> &nbsp;</strong>You can still visit their original tasting room and vineyard outside of Dallas and enjoy the spectacular views of the vines and the rolling hills of the Willamette Valley.</p> <p>Outdoor enthusiasts will find new adventures in the area, too. &nbsp;Approximately 30 miles east of Salem on the beautiful Santiam River sits the newly opened <a href=""http://www.co.marion.or.us/PW/Parks/descriptions/bearcreek.htm""><strong>Bear Creek Campground</strong></a> ‰ÛÒ a 15-acre campground featuring 15 camp sites, picnic tables, designated swimming areas and hiking trails.

Oregon is recognized worldwide as being clean, green, innovative and progressive. In the forefront is Salem‰Û_developing and investing in green job opportunities by attracting environmental and energy related companies to the area. Salem‰Ûªs groundbreaking of the Sanyo solar cell factory last October and the development of 515-acre of ‰ÛÏshovel ready‰Ûù land in the Mill Creek Corporate Center are examples of how Salem embodies Oregon‰Ûªs reputation as a green and sustainable state. Additionally, Salem area businesses and organizations are contributing in a unified approach to being green by becoming EarthWISE certified, a Marion County program that recognizes businesses that have made a commitment to environmentally friendly practices. </p><p>Travel Oregon has had great success in marketing and promoting the state. Oregon is home to some of the greatest attractions, events, outdoor recreation, agriculture, and arts and culture. Those very features are seen in abundance in the Salem area and embodies the best of what Oregon has to offer: A lively downtown surrounded by historic buildings, museums, and attractions; beautiful and natural environment ideal for outdoor recreational activities; unique festivals and events showcasing the vibrant and diverse community; and the advantage of relishing some of the state‰Ûªs best performing and visual art in an urban setting, yet be minutes away from a rural retreat with award-winning wineries amid breathtaking views in the heart of the Willamette Valley. </p><p>After reviewing research from focus groups, online surveys, and a visitor profile study, Travel Salem found that the word ‰ÛÏAbsolutely‰Ûù (e.g., ‰ÛÏAbsolutely beautiful,‰Ûù ‰ÛÏAbsolutely spectacular‰Ûù) was consistently used by residents and visitors to describe the attractiveness of the area; prompting the formation of the slogan ‰ÛÏAbsolutely Oregon.‰Ûù </p><p>‰ÛÏWe wanted to capitalize on the great diversity and vibrancy that Salem possesses,‰Ûù said Angie Morris, chief executive officer for Travel Salem. ‰ÛÏSalem is clean, green, and rich in diverse products and recreational opportunities. It‰Ûªs also the capital city, which is very significant to the region and a great point of interest for visitors. There‰Ûªs a little bit more Oregon here in Salem than anywhere else,‰Ûù said Morris. </p><p><strong>Visual Element</strong><br />Travel Salem established a Brand Council, chaired by Roger Yost, that consisted of board members (representatives from Salem and Marion and Polk counties) to oversee the formation of the visual aspect of the brand. Travel Salem contracted with <em>In House Graphics</em>, a graphic design company based in Salem, to develop the visual element of the brand. </p><p>‰ÛÏThe actual look of the logo is meant to be sparse and sophisticated but convey the richness of our region,‰Ûù said Morris. ‰ÛÏThe actual graphic representation of the image and the colors and fonts were chosen to convey to the visitor and anyone that sees it what the region is all about as a destination.‰Ûù </p><p><strong>Specific Components</strong><br />Travel Salem‰Ûªs logo consists of several components that symbolize the overall concept of the brand: </p><ul>	<li><strong>Dancer</strong>: Salem is a culturally significant city through diversity and arts (performing, visual, etc.). These things are woven into the community and are part of what shapes this city. Salem is active with one-of-a-kind events and activities. The Dancer illustrates the personal aspect of the community and true movement. Oregon‰Ûªs State Motto is, ‰ÛÏShe flies with her own wings.‰Ûù Oregon is referred to as a woman. As Oregon‰Ûªs state capital the dancer also represents Oregon. </li>	<li><strong>Urban Landscape</strong>: Salem is Oregon‰Ûªs capital city, where Oregon‰Ûªs history is alive. It is a bustling community with diverse jobs opportunities (e.g., government, business, industry). </li>	<li><strong>Buildings</strong>: Salem is a major city in Oregon with a lively downtown that embraces its historic assets to create a vibrant destination. </li>	<li><strong>Mountains and River</strong>: Salem is nestled in the heart of the Willamette Valley in a beautiful setting surrounded by mountains, agriculture and rivers. It is urban yet minutes away from nature. Salem is a healthy environment with many outdoor recreational opportunities. </li>	<li><strong>Crops and Wine Country</strong>: Salem is in partnership with nature in the midst of wine country. Agriculture is still very much a part of this urban city with rich soil, green verdant countryside, commodities, bounty and beauty. </li>	<li><strong>Absolutely Oregon</strong>: As Oregon‰Ûªs state capital, the Salem area absolutely represents Oregon. It is where state government and law regarding our state take shape, and where Oregon‰Ûªs first provisional government was formed (Champoeg/Marion County). The bounty of the region in regards to agriculture, history, culture, natural attractions, scenic beauty, cleanliness, hospitality of the people, and large and small communities is uniquely Oregon. </li>	<li><strong>Colors</strong>: Sage green represents the environmental and outdoorsy aspect of the region. Gold represents the Capitol (gold pioneer) and the maroon represents the vibrancy and richness of the Salem area. </li>	<li><strong>Font</strong>: The flowing and scripted font for ‰ÛÏTravel‰Ûù conveys life, excitement, art, movement, and vibrancy. ‰ÛÏSalem‰Ûù has a bold and prominent font, expressing the city and the region takes itself seriously as a premier destination. </li></ul><p><strong>Establishing Salem‰Ûªs Brand</strong><br />‰ÛÏAbsolutely Oregon‰Ûù fits well in Travel Salem‰Ûªs efforts to position the Salem area as a premier destination. Using the ‰ÛÏAbsolutely‰Ûù piece of the slogan as a transferrable marketing element, other industries, businesses and organizations will have the opportunity to create their own catchphrase while establishing synergy in all marketing efforts to create one brand for Salem. </p><p>Travel Salem convened a group of key stakeholders to develop a solidified brand position for Salem. Key stakeholders included Mayor Janet Taylor, Mike McLaren of the Salem Area Chamber of Commerce, Ray Burstedt of SEDCOR (Strategic Economic Development Corporation), and Suzi Bicknell of Go Downtown! This group reviewed opportunities related to ‰ÛÏAbsolutely Oregon,‰Ûù and settled on an approach that would help give Salem a solidified platform to position and market economic development opportunities. Using Absolutely‰Ûù as the through line that ties Salem‰Ûªs brand together, key economic development partners will incorporate the following into their own brand and marketing strategies: </p><ul>	<li><strong>Salem Area Chamber of Commerce</strong>: ‰ÛÏLeading Businesses Absolutely‰Ûù<br />	<strong>SEDCOR</strong>: ‰ÛÏAbsolutely Ready‰Ûù<br />	<strong>Go Downtown!</strong>: ‰ÛÏGo Downtown for Absolutely Everything‰Ûù </li></ul><p>‰ÛÏWith the recent name change to Travel Salem and this Salem brand that the organization has created, it has become more clearly defined the important role of our community in attracting tourism to support the economy of the area,‰Ûù said Janet Taylor, mayor of Salem. ‰ÛÏThe fact that it ties into the State tourism strategies allows us to leverage our local dollars to reach a wider range of travelers. We are so fortunate to have the passion and skills of our Travel Salem organization to lead this effort,‰Ûù said Mayor Taylor. </p><p>‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs important that Salem has a strong branding strategy to be competitive among growing cities,‰Ûù said Bicknell, executive director of Go Downtown! ‰ÛÏFurthermore, it‰Ûªs significant that individual entities within Salem carry on the same message to solidify the Salem marketplace.‰Ûù </p><p>‰ÛÏThis provides great opportunities for all organizations in the area to be connected in a unified approach and at the same time keep their own flavor,‰Ûù said McLaren, chief executive officer for the Salem Area Chamber of Commerce. </p><p>The Association has trademarked ‰ÛÏAbsolutely Oregon‰Ûù and ‰ÛÏTravel CafÌ©‰Ûù and will be implementing these verbiages into all marketing efforts. </p><p>All businesses and organizations are encouraged to get on board and tie-in to Salem‰Ûªs brand. If a business or organization is interested in tapping into this powerful brand identity, please contact Travel Salem which will oversee and ensure the integrity of the ‰ÛÏAbsolutely Oregon‰Ûù brand. </p><p align=""center"">### </p><p><span class=""style2""><em>***Travel Salem is a non-profit organization that promotes Salem and Marion and Polk counties for leisure tourism and convention and event business.

In addition, Travel Salem‰Ûªs conference room has been named the ‰ÛÏWillamette Room‰Ûù sponsored by WVV.<br /><br />This unique partnership between a winery/vineyard and a tourism agency will allow visitors to experience wine from one of Oregon‰Ûªs oldest and most sustainable wineries, and pique their interest to learn more about WVV and the region‰Ûªs rich wine country. This new concept will ultimately lead to an increased regional economic impact from tourism.<br /><br />‰ÛÏWillamette Valley Vineyards is proud to be partnering with Travel Salem‰Ûªs revolutionary Travel CafÌ©,‰Ûù says Jim Bernau, founder and president of WVV. ‰ÛÏThis new downtown facility is one of the major touch points for visitors to the Salem area. Offering tastes of wine at this location will grow visitor interest in the Oregon wine industry ‰ÛÓ one of our region‰Ûªs most valuable assets ‰ÛÓ and help make lifelong Salem area customers of some of these visitors.‰Ûù<br /><br />‰ÛÏPart of the original vision for the Travel CafÌ©, this innovative partnership provides yet another reason for visitors to make the Salem area a stop on their journey,‰Ûù explained Travel Salem President and CEO Angie Morris. ‰ÛÏBy serving as a mini-attraction, the Travel CafÌ© seeks to give visitors a taste of what the region has to offer. We wanted a partner that exemplified the best of the tourism industry ‰ÛÒ innovation, sustainability and an internationally recognized brand. We got all of that and more with Willamette Valley Vineyards.<br /><br />Travel Salem and WVV launched this partnership by kicking off their shoes at the Mini Grape Stomp event held at the Travel CafÌ© on September 16, 2009. Bernau and Morris teamed up and went toe-to-toe against Ray Burstedt, president of SEDCOR and Austin McGuigan, community development director of Polk County ‰ÛÓ in a grape stomping competition right outside the Travel CafÌ©. The stomping of Morris and the swabbing of Bernau propelled the Travel Salem/ WVV grape stomping team to an easy victory.åÊ <br /><br />This partnership expands on Travel Salem‰Ûªs commitment to reinvent the way a community connects with visitors and local consumers. The Travel CafÌ© offers Garmin GPS units pre-programmed with Salem area tours, AbsolutelyTix ticketing network, Wi-Fi access, plasma screens with ads and scrolling events, and now wine-tasting with WVV. The Travel CafÌ© is becoming an attraction in and of itself!<br /><br />Wine-tasting will be available Monday-Saturday, 11:00 a.m. ‰ÛÒ 4:30 p.m. at the Travel CafÌ© located at 181 High St. NE, Salem. Eight distinctive wines will be featured; offering something for every palate. The wines will be served using a state-of-the-art Enomatic wine serving system. Visitors and local consumers can purchase four tastes for $6.00, which will include a one-of-a-kind Riedel wine glass. Bottles of WVV wines are also available for purchase.<br /><br /><strong>About Willamette Valley Vineyards:</strong> Willamette Valley Vineyards was founded in 1983 by Jim Bernau after an inspirational visit to the west-to-south facing slope of volcanic flow in Turner, Ore., where the winery is now situated. Best known for its acclaimed Pinot Noir, WVV wines are distributed throughout the United States, Canada, and the Pacific Rim.
